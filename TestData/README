The files are structured as follows (starting with line 1):

The first line is the number of documents in the data set.
The second line is the number of words accross all documents in the data set.
The third line is the number of non-zero entries in the document matrix. That
    is, how many document-to-word connections there are in the data set. This
    can be used to approximate the optimal K value (number of clusters).

The remaining lines represent entrees in the document matrix. The first number
    is the document ID (starting at 1). The second number is the word ID (also
    starting at 1). The third number is how many times that word appears in
    said document.
