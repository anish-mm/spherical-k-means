main.cpp:
    - processes user arguments and sets up runtime flags
    - calls the reader functions to read in data file(s)
    - creates and runs the specified SPKMeans object
reader.h/cpp:
    - global functions that read and process the text data files
vectors.h/cpp:
    - global functions for operations on vectors (i.e. float arrays)
timer.h/cpp:
    - Timer object for measuring multicore runtime (uses Boost library)
cluster_data.h/cpp (ClusterData class):
    - ClusterData object contains all data structures and variables used while clustering
    - used by the SPKMeans algorithms
spkmeans.h:
    - declarations for all of the SPKMeans classes
    - SPKMeansGalois and SPKMeansOpenMP inherit from SPKMeans
spkmeans.cpp:
    - SPKMeans class: a single-thread version of the algorithm
spkmeans_openmp.cpp:
    - SPKMeansOpenMP class: parallel version using OpenMP
spkmeans_galois.cpp:
    - SPKMeansGalois class: parallel version using Galois
