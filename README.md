Spherical K-Means Algorithm
=======

An implementation of the spherical K-means algorithm in Matlab, C++ and Python.

The C++ version emphasizes a multithreaded implementation, and features three ways of running the algorithm. It can be executed normally (identical to the Matlab implementation), or using OpenMP or Galois (http://iss.ices.utexas.edu/?p=projects/galois). The purpose of this code is to optimize and compare the different parallel paradigms to maximize the efficiency of the algorithm.

The Python version is currently incomplete.
